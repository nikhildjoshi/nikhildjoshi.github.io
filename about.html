	<h1 class="title">About</h1>

	<p><strong>Long</strong> time ago, on the South Asian Servers, a new playe logged in for the first time. Following the rules of game, a randomly generated profile was assigned to him. He was assigned the role of a 2nd sibling of two, in a family of 4. His father was a dokotor, mother an advocate. His elder sibling who was level 5 grifed him quite a bit early game.</p>

<p>His family belonged to the clan of Joshi (a priestly star-gazer class) that had moved from their ancestral feudal lands on the northern banks of Godavari, to, a spwraling education related town called Pune. His father belonged to one of the 7 brothers of Joshis.</p>

<p>Following the ritualistic naming conventions of his house, he was named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikhil">Nikhil</a>. It means “complete”, infinite or universal. With his last name, he would mean “the complete star-gazer”, or “the universal star-gazer”</p>

<p>His early survival was based on support roles, and he specd into social skill tree till Level 4. After level 4 his server was re-sharded, and his team couldn’t play as a team, as they ended up on different shards. Following this, his xp generation plumetted and he basically cursed the distribution of his attributes and skills.</p>

<p>He then decide to fork some coin and re-specd the character. He also realized that greedy approach on spending attribute and skill points won’t help him in end game superiority.</p>

<p>He changed his class from support to solo, and moved around his attributes to suite solo play. He choose to specialize in tech skill tree. To accomplish this he had to first improve his science and mathematic skill trees in early game. He min maxed a bit, and didn’t have great xp generation early game.</p>

<p>He got the “experimenter” and “experimental science” perks after some time of play.  He min maxed even more as time went by, and removed almost all points from the language and social skill trees. At level 11, he had already unlocked “the knack” perk by investing lot of points into the science trees. He then started investing heavily into the now unlocked trees of computer science and electronics. He got the perks of “tech bachelor”. Finally he unlocked the “mastery of technology” perk. The only one thing out of his reach would at this time be the “te tech dokotor”  skill, which he would not achieve, and instead opt for a more off-the-cuff play that balanced out his more theoretically inclined skill tree.</p>

<p>He still keeps fair number of points in his science &amp; maths tech trees, in order to use the “DIY” and “Effective DIY” perks, to craft novel items and use them in game, without spending much gold.</p>

<p>He currently is part of one of the top 3 guilds on the world wide server. He is currently semi min-maxed magus, no sorcery lies beyond his grasp.</p>
