	<p><strong>T</strong>oday, I again stumbled on an interesting article on how the whilstling rockets work. Actually, I was thinking about it since last month, when I experimented with DIY gunpowder.</p>

<p>How do those whistling rockets work ? Really….</p>

<h6 id="basics-of-sound">Basics of Sound</h6>

<p>From my original understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound">Sound</a>, sound is produced when the high frequency (relatively) pressure differences are created in a medium, typically air. Those differences are then picked up by ear drums, and through a complex path, are interpreted as noise by the brain.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour">The perceived volume is different for different frequencies but same amplitude</a>. Something I had known thanks to the Multimedia and Compression theory lessons of my college years. Kind of easily seen if you think about bats, who’s voice we cannot hear, and dogs, who can hear sound at a higher frequency than us.</p>

<p>Fun(?) fact, as you grow old, your perception of high frequency sounds drops quite a bit. <a href="http://egopont.com/hearing.php">Check it out here!</a></p>

<p>A related concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance">resonance</a>, is simply explained by an example of swing. Resonance periodically increases amplitude of a oscilating/alternating phenomena, by adding small amounts of energy incrementally at right point of time, so that the overall energy increases. Eg. Pushing the swing when they are about to change direction. Anyway, for sound waves to reach enough amplitude, it may sometimes be necessary to bank on the resonance of the container.</p>

<h6 id="thought-experiment-1--whistles">Thought experiment 1 : Whistles</h6>
<p>A whistle works by blowing air through it. A whistle works in an opposite fashion to resonance. In general a whistle works by producing oscilations by dividing a single pressure stream of air, into two, and these streams to conflict with each other to produce the oscilations.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_of_whistles#Police_whistle">Check out phy of police whistle here</a></p>

<p>Maybe the smoke produced from the burning of the fuel, produces a flow, that when passed through a whistle like apparatus produces a whistle ? I do remember, that few of those rockets in my early teens that we used to light, did have a set of flute like holes.</p>

<p>However, I do remember, that there were fire crackers with a “white” fuel/mix, that used to also whistle, there was most definitely no apparatus just the plain mixture and an empty tube.</p>

<p>So there is definitely something more to it.</p>

<h6 id="look-online">Look online</h6>
<p>Alright so the whistle in whistling rockets is due to a chemical effect. Apparently the white mix is called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle_mix">Whistle mix</a></strong>, and it supposedly has a chemical property known as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisance">Brisance</a></strong> Brisance appears bad news, it apparently relates to detonation, which is an ability of a mixture to burst at speeds faster than sound, thus their damage energy is high.</p>

<p>Searched again, and there seem to be multiple websites demonstraing the whistle mixes, and apparently there are multiple of these. <a href="https://pyrodata.com/composition/whistle-mix?tid_1%5B%5D=10&amp;rocket-Title=&amp;field_video_video_url=All&amp;description=All&amp;description_1=All">PyroData</a> is one such example.</p>

<p>Alright, so I needed pottasium chlorate, and sodium benzoate.</p>

<h6 id="stand-back-i-am-going-to-try-science-">Stand back, I am going to try science !</h6>

<p>Okay, sodium benzoate is a food preservative, and I have some of it for creating pickles. Since the article says the mixture demonstrates brisance, I am not going to make anything more than 1 to 2 gm at a time.</p>

<p>The only missing part is pottasium chlorate. Again googled some more, and found out that this can be produced using electro chemistry ! Gotta do some work, but will be on this electro chemistry business in a few days.</p>
