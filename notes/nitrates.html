	<p><strong>Nitrates</strong> the oxidizer that we saw last post, is the main ingredient of gunpowder.
But now questions is how to produce this ? Or rather how did people produce this in history , and can we produce it ? This post contains some information regarding my information gathering for producing Pottasium nitrate…</p>

<p>In ancient China, and India, it was produced by harvesting the marshy clay and purifying it, add water, then boil, then add ash of particular high pottasium woods, and then , filter the stuff again. Boil to reduce the water, and then let it cool, see the crystals of Kno3 precipitate. They are needle shaped.</p>

<p>Ashes of woods contain carbonates of calcium, pottasium etc.. Then clearly those that contain more pottasium will contain more pottasium carbonate (KCO3). The K in the KCO3 is what we are after, and hence the use of wood ash.</p>

<p>Now, why are there nitrates in marshy lands in the first place ?</p>

<p>Enter <strong>The Nitrogen Cycle</strong>.</p>

<h6 id="nitrogen-cycle">Nitrogen Cycle.</h6>
<p>Nitrogen cycle describes conversion of elemental nitrogen (N2 gas in air) to various compounds of nitrogen, and how nitrogen moves in and out of organic compounds.</p>

<p>This is a diagram from wikipedia commons, that very succicintly describes the cycle.
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/The_Nitrogen_Cycle.png" alt="Nitrogen Cycle" /></p>

<p>Alright, so the important part for us is the nitrification cycle, as you can see nitrifying bacteria are the bacteria that take amonia as input, and produce nitrites (NO2), then some other bacteria take the nitrite, and produce nitrates (NO3).</p>

<p>Nitrates(NO3) as you know are the radical that we need to combine with Pottasium (K) to produce the oxidizer Pottasium Nitrates (KNO3).</p>

<p>The conversion of Amonium or Amonia to nitrite is done by classes of bacteria called “Amonia Oxidizing Bacteria” (AOB). One of these are called <strong>Nitrosomonas</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2.NH4(+) + 3.O2 --&gt; 2.NO2(-) + 2.H2O + 4.H(+) ...[yours truly Nitrosomonas, Comammox]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The conversion of nitrite(NO2) to nitrates(NO3) is done by class of bacteria called Nitrite Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB). One of these are called <strong>Nitrobacter</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2.NO2(−) + O2 --&gt; 2.NO3(-) ...[yours truely,Nitrobacter, Nitrospira, Comammox]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="enough-with-the-theory--how-do-i-do-it-">Enough with the theory , how do I do it !</h5>

<p>So by 17th to 18th century, there were multiple production techniques that were developed that created artificial marshy conditions in hope of harnessing whatever ‘magic’ that created the nitrates in natural marshes. And these people were more or less successful in their efforts.</p>

<p>Alright, so lets think about this, we need as input amonia or amonium thats NH3 or NH4, then, we want as output NO2 and then NO3, alright then, we need oxygen for sure. Turns out, AOBs need CO2 to oxidize NH3/4 to NO2.</p>

<p>Historical source for amonia was urine, which contains urea(CH4N2O). We then need oxygen (we can get that from air at reasonable rates), and , our friendly bacteria the AOBs , that will take oxygen from air, do their magic, and produce nitrites.</p>

<p>Our other friends, NOBs will then take this nitrite and then convert it into nitrates.</p>

<p>Then we will leech(fancy word for dissolving in water, and seperating by flitration) the nitrates from the said mush, and get a solution of nitrates (potentially calcium nitrates). We can then treat it with KCL to get KNo3.</p>

<h6 id="todo">TODO</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Need to get a source of urea/amonia, probably just urine.</li>
  <li>Nitrifying bacteria are available as aquarium cleaning aids.</li>
  <li>Pottasium is available as Pottasium chloride or Potash.</li>
  <li>I always wanted to do some hydroponics experiments, probably I will do this when I am dealing with hydroponics.</li>
  <li>It should also be noted that those nitrates in water are probably pottasium nitrates (CaNO3), which when reacted with potash (KCO3) can potentially produce KNO3.</li>
</ul>
