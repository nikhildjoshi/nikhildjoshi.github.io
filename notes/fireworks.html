	<p><strong>When</strong> I was between 7 to 18yrs of age. Fireworks were one of my most fav things to waste time on.
I am a Hindu, and there is a festival of Diwali(lights), thats a period where everyone* bursts a bunch
 of fireworks. Its supposed to ward off evil, and create positive impact.  I was always fascinated by 
the fireworks, but since internet wasn’t a thing back then, knowledge was limited.
I used to ask my dad(who was a dokotor) or then one of my paternal uncles, or learn by observation,
primary source was observing my brothers, cousins, and friends.</p>

<p>A few things I could figure out on my own, or by observing others. My very first firecracker experience was
when I was maybe about 5 yrs old, and I was so scared of it, that I fell while running, away.
Then after observing my brother, I finally understood how it works, and it was kinda neat. Use a hot
stick to light it, and after a set time it explodes. My elder cousins would take the mis-fired firecrackers
cut it open, pour out the powder on a paper, and set it on fire, that would cause a flash of smoke and fire
when the said powder burned. It was all very cool to see. I had assumed back then that the powder was something like
1) a match stick, 2) a camphor 3) petrol/kerosene which are all inflamable. I knew the basic science that
Oxygen was needed to light fire, but didn’t make the connection, that there are sources of oxygen other than
air. For me back then, petrol and gunpowder were both almost the same w.r.t fire, both of them burned vigorously when lit
on fire. Oh yeah, and I knew about camphor because its a central item in Hindu rituals.</p>

<p>After gaining this new info, I cut open a few fireworks. Observation was that firecrackers that would explode with loud bang
contained some kind of silvery-grey powder, when it was on the hand, it reflected a silvery metalic color.
The rockets, or crackers in general that wizz, had a dark, almost black smooth powder, this looked like soot
from lamps. Flowerpots etc, had some time of peletts. These beads would just glow for a while and then do nothing.
There was some wierd powder, that I never understood, it was white in color, and there was nothing like it
in any of the other firecrackers. This powder, was from crackers that produced a musical note.</p>

<p>In my early teens, I used to mix two pots together, or , add another cracker on a rocket, or , use
sparkels, and add them into pots etc etc… basicall just basic combining things to see whats produced.
I remember doing a pretty good firepot made from rocket dust, and crushed sparkels. There always was one effect
that I couldn’t produce…nor did I understand how it worked.</p>

<p>This was the whistling effect. I noticed early on that the firecrackers that produced this whistle were costly.
They wizzed like rockets. They had a white powder, that didn’t burn like any of the other powders. It either lit
up quite quickly, or just smoked. At this time, I wasn’t clever enough at that time to figure out, how were they
producing sound. My theory was its gotta do with the container they are in, like for eg. a whistle. To my surprise
they still produced whistle , no matter how I changed the container shape… so it was a mystry to me.</p>

<p>I do remember reading somewhere that there are some special compositions involved in creating black powder,
but I never did it, never made the time, Diwali is seasonal affair, and immediately following diwali, we had some
educational stuff to do. I do remember reading somewhere that there are some special compositions involved in 
creating black powder, but I never did it, never got the time.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I came across an interesting article on nitrates leeching into soil, and while reading some of that
realized that nitrates are one of the main oxidizers used in fireworks. Finally I am now somewhat stable from 
some aspects of my life, that I can invest some time in this as a hobby. Starting today I am going to try to DIY 
a few things, and get a closure on something that 
I always wanted to do.. in particular create some black powder, and ultimately create a whistle based off of 
firework compositions.</p>

<p>Lets see how it goes..</p>
