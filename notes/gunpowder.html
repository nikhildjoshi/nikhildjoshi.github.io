	<p><strong>Alright</strong> staying true to my goal, I have some time this week. Read a few things about gunpowder, and fire in general.
To summarize it quickly, to make fire, we need fuel, oxygen, and some activation energy. Thinking back at my childhood experiences
this makes sense, almost everytime I have lit fire, those 3 were present.</p>

<p>The important bit now is how to get oxygen. Oxygen is at ~20% in air, so a burning substance has 8 in 10 chance of not combusting
becuse of lack of oxygen. So, how do we improve flow of oxygen ? The easiest way is to find chemical compounds that release oxygen
when they are heated. As we apply the activation energy in the form of fire, this substance will heat, and release additional oxygen
into the fuel, that will burn the fuel more than if it was burnt only by oxygen in air. This particular set of substances used for
producing oxygen are called <strong>oxidizers</strong>.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I do remember about reading a rocket working principle book, that had oxygen along with fuel in its tanks. Also , I don’t remember ever reading that increasing the amount of oxygen cause more vigirous burning of fuels in my school science texts. Its somewhat dangerous to not teach this.</p>

<p>Coming back to the topic of oxidizers, apparently pottasium nitrate is the most famous of them all, and most ancient of them all.
The origin of gunpowder is as is a difficult subject, some people claim it was China, some claim it was India. Well, both of these
places have large marshy lands, which are primmed for production of nitrates. More on nitrates in a later post. Since there are more proofs that point to Chinese origins, we will go with that.</p>

<p>For our gunpowder experiment, the general formula is sulphur, charcoal powder, and pottasium nitrate mixed in a 5, 20, 75 ratio. There are a few things to keep in mind, while doing this experiment. First, its related to fire (Agni) so be respectful (alert). Second, we do not want to do any crazy things,</p>

<p>After getting all the required things , I tested each of the substances individually:</p>
<h6 id="sulphur">Sulphur</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Applying a match, it will burn with a blue flame.</li>
  <li>Combustion starts at about 400C.</li>
  <li>Melts at about 115C.</li>
  <li>In case of gunpowder, sulphur plays an important role. It first of all is used to equally spread the heat , so that the oxidizer starts releasing oxygen early in the game, this saturates the air around the mixture with oxygen.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="charcoal">Charcoal</h6>
<ul>
  <li>On application of a match, charcoal powder produced some sparks.</li>
  <li>Produced by pyrolysis of wood.</li>
  <li>Hydrocarbon, with varying formula, but typically C6H10.</li>
  <li>Its a hydrocarbon that burns at around 700+ C.</li>
  <li>At its max, it can burn at more than 2000+ C.</li>
  <li>This is the main fuel for gunpowder, given its high energy content.</li>
  <li>It has many micro porus structures, which can soak up other chemicals. for eg. activated charcoal is used to trap chemicals in water.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="pottasium-nitrate-kno3">Pottasium Nitrate (KNO3)</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Undoubtedly the MVP of this gunpowder thing…</li>
  <li>The Nitrate radicle has 3 oxygen atoms.</li>
  <li>These atoms can be released as diatomic oxygen(o2) on application of heat
at around 500C.</li>
  <li>This release of oxygen is what makes it most usefull compound. Such compounds are generally termed "oxidizers".</li>
  <li>This doesn’t burn, melts on application of match, and then converts into a white solids (KCo3)</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="bonus-ingredient-sucrose-c6h12o6">Bonus ingredient Sucrose (C6H12O6)</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Common house hold sugar is carbohydrate (as opposed to hydrocarbon).
Carbs conain oxygen atoms also, in addition to C, and H.</li>
  <li>It burns at around 300 to 400C, and produces a carbon residue.</li>
  <li>It melts at 160C.</li>
  <li>Burning of sucrose produces a LOT of high temprature steam.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="principle-of-operation">Principle of operation</h6>
<p>Now that we know how individual ingredients operate, we now simply need to mix them in appropriate proportions. The generally accepted proportions for sulphur : charcoal : nitrate is 15:20:75. This formula has changed quite a bit based on what type wood was used for production of the charcoal.</p>

<p>Alright, so the way this is supposed to work is, sulphur is the first one to melt and ignite, the heated melted sulphur in turn heats the nitrate, causing decomposition, and release of oxygen, this further builds up the heat, causing more oxygen, untill it ultimately reaches charcoal ignition tempratures, and then things just fly from there onwards.
Generally accepted simplistic formula is stated as :</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	10.KNO3 + 8.C + 3.S ---&gt; 2.K2CO3 + 3.K2SO4 + 6.CO2 + 5.N2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h6 id="preparation">Preparation</h6>
<p>Since I want to iterate faster, and there are multiple thing I want to try I will make no more than 5g powder at a time. There are multiple things I need to try, and multiple preparation methods.</p>

<p>The basic thrust of all preparation methods is to introduce as many KNo3 molecules closer to Charcol molecules as possible. And there have been suggested various methods. I will try three main methods, first a simple mixing using mortar pestle, two, using wet mortal pestle, and three with sugar syrup instead of water.</p>

<h6 id="observations">Observations</h6>
<p>Various different 5g powder samples prepared and ignited, here are few key things that I noticed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding sulphur makes very little impact on burn rate.</li>
  <li>Method of preparation makes a LOT of impact on burn rate.</li>
  <li>Reducing KNO3 quantity doesn’t affect much, if, mixing isn’t done properly, it simply leaves residue, but burn speed isn’t affected that much.</li>
  <li>Adding some sugar causes the mixture to become hard and grainy, this causes more air gaps between the mixtures, and that probably cause better burn rate.</li>
  <li>Adding sulphur produces a lot more heat than without sulphur.</li>
  <li>Shit ton of smoke is produced if sulphur is added. If sulphur is not added, the amount of smoke is less than half of with sulphur(approximation).</li>
  <li>Wet grinding is the way to go, just take some water and keep on grinding the mixture a good about 5 mins. Dry it throughly.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="my-best-attempt">My best attempt</h6>
<p>The best mix I obtained was simply Charcoal, Kno3, Sugar in quantities of 30 : 65 : 5, with water grinding. This is safe mixture that doesn’t produce any corrosive gases or anything like it.</p>

<h6 id="bonus-composition-rocket-candy">Bonus composition "Rocket candy"</h6>
<p>Alright adding sugar and Kno3 in proportions roughly 50:50 or 40:60. The mixture is prepared by boiling some water with kno3 and sugar, at <strong>VERY LOW HEAT</strong>. I repeat <strong>VERY LOW HEAT</strong>. Stop it as soon as it reaches a melted cheese like consistency. Once its stopped, the mix is like a dough, or a molten glass, its hot, and mouldable, just mold it into a shape. When its cold, it is like a candy.</p>

<p>I did a 10 grams composition, and that stuff produces lots of steam, it also seems to have quite a bit of energy. When I made it burn, it produced some type of motion, so clearly it has energy to propell, hence the name Rocket candy.</p>
