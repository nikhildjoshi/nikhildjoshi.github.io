	<p><strong>Back on subject of fireworks</strong>, now that I am pretty much done with gunpowder and rocket candies, now its time for another firework trick mixture, “flash powder”. A flash powder is a mixture of oxidizer and a fuel, just like gunpowder or rocket candy. The reason its called <strong>flash powder</strong> is because it burns more vigirously and produces a bright flash.</p>

<h6 id="history">History</h6>

<p>The original application of flash powders was in photography. Since there weren’t halogens or any other powerfull sources of light, the effect was produced by actually burning flash powders in order to create the flash.</p>

<h6 id="ruminations">Ruminations</h6>

<p>I know from my middle school that magnesium burns pretty bright, that was the first thing that came to my mind, and sure enough, magnesium is definitely one of the major ingredients in flash powder, its costly though :). Since I am not doing anything serious, and I am not going to become a proffessional pyrotechnic, I am contended with doing simple cheap alternatives.</p>

<p>I will be using <strong>aluminium</strong>. I had no clue that finely powdered aluminium is actually a fuel that burns almost like charcoal! Nay, better than charcoal, it supposedly can sponteneously ignite at lower tempratures than charcoal.</p>

<p>Some surprises here, in my view , I had thought for the longest time that metals don’t burn except at a very high temprature.. T_T. Looks like metals when their size is small enough act almost like a " sponge " that captures and either adds to, or multiplies the heat absorbed from outside and somehow reaches ignition tempratures, for example iron burns at 816 degree C, but, I have seen iron wool burn with a matchstick.</p>

<p>Similarly aluminium burns at 600 degree C.</p>

<p>Alright, so I am going to combine some coal, aluminium and some nitrate. I hope to get atleast some flash out of this.</p>

<h6 id="metals-as-fuels-">Metals as fuels ?</h6>

<h6 id="experiment">Experiment</h6>

<p>I took some coal nitrate and aluminium. Firstly I took them in proportions of 70, 25, 5. 5 being aluminium. And sure enough, it does throw up bright sparks in between coal sparks. It appears quite beautiful.</p>

<p>I tried a second mixture, with ratios 60, 10, 30. And this is quite bright, but doesn’t burn compltely.</p>

<h6 id="bonus-composition--thermite">Bonus composition : Thermite</h6>

<p>Thermite is as a composition is perhaps the best in terms of heat production. This simple mixture is made up of rust of Iron (Fe2O3, Fe2O5 etc) and aluminium. A finely powedered mixture of rust and aluminium can be mixed together througly, and after application of some energy, the oxygen from the iron transfers to the more unstable aluminium. The reaction is highly exothermic, and tempratures enough to melt iron is generated.</p>

<p>This technique is so effective in generating molten iron, that this is used to weld train tracks! For reference train tracks are atleast 15cm by 5cm.</p>
<h6 id="observations">Observations</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Looks like to burn aluminium properly, you first need some charcoal based fire, that reaches the burning point of aluminium, and then they all vigirously burn and support each other.</li>
  <li>A small amount of aluminium will throw up bright yellow-white sparks in between the more dimmer reddish coal sparks.</li>
  <li>Recording this behavior is somewhat of a nightmare due to auto adjusting brightness of all modern cameras.</li>
  <li>You will be able to feel the temprature difference if you burn a metal fuel (mostly aluminium).</li>
</ul>
