	<p><strong>Pottasium Chlorate</strong> written as <script type="math/tex">KClO_3</script> is the specialist ingredient that I am after. The first order of business for me was to quickly go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_chlorate">wikipedia article</a>.
It is an oxidizer, just like what we saw <script type="math/tex">KNO_3</script> in <a href="./gunpowder">gunpowder post</a>, but, its considered even better oxidizer than <script type="math/tex">KNO_3</script> (ie. Pottasium nitrate).</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-mean-a-better-oxidizer-">What do you mean a “better” oxidizer ?</h4>

<p>For this we need to understand what an oxidizer means. At its most basic, oxidation we can think of oxidation of an element as that element reacting with Oxygen, and forming a new compound, that contains the said oxygen bound chemically to the substance other than oxygen before the reaction happened. In general these reactions produce heat, light and other forms of energy.</p>

<p>A relatively easy form of oxidation can be considered to be burning of Magnesium.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2Mg + O_2 -> 2MgO + heat + light</script>

<p>Atomic number of Oxygen is 8, and Magnesium is 12, Neon with atomic number of 10 is closest to them and it is stable. Therefore Magnesium will loose 2 electrons, and Oxygen wil gain two electrons, then they will reach the same 10 electron state as Neon. <a href="http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/143Amgoxide.html">This page</a> describes the above in much greater detail.
One another way explanation that I found interesting was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_rule">Octet Rule</a>. It basically states that each of those atoms will try to form an electron configuration that is near to a inert gas atomically on a periodic table.</p>

<p>So here we say that Oxygen “oxidized” Magnesium. A simple way to remember this is :</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>OIL, Oxidiation is Loss (of electrons),</p>

  <p>RIG, Reduction is gain (of electrons).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now what is a better oxidizer ? A oxidizing agent is termed “stronger” if it has a stronger standard electrode potential. The way these are calculated are beyond scope of this page, but you can read more here <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Chemical/electrode2.html#c1">Oxidation, Reduction, and standard electrode potential</a></p>

<p>Another way to describe the same as above is using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity">Electronegativity and positivity of a substance</a></p>

<p>There could be other measures, for eg How many grams of an oxidizer can oxidize how many grams of substance.
And, how much energy is released (although this is also ) kinda dependant on which fuel is being used.</p>

<p>Anyway…</p>

<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>

<p>So to create a chlorate, all that needs to be done is to electrolyze a salt solution. Crazy ! But it appears that what this does, is to create bleach (KCLO), then chlorite and then chlorate (and if we go too long, then perchlorate). More on the processes involved here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloralkali_process">Chloro-Alkali Processes</a></p>
