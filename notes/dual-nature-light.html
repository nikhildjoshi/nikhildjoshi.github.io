	<p><strong>L</strong>ight, such an interesting form of energy! Since an animal is born, and it opens eyes for the first time, this energy enters their eyes, and provides a massive information flow.
Probably the most information they will ever get is from the medium of light.</p>

<p>Today I stumbled on an article for dual nature of light. It is a fascinatiing concept.  So I wanted to see this for myself, so I tried to see what could be done to get this going , my solution was to use a hair as a windowing/splitting mechanism, on top of a laser pointer, and that worked like a charm !</p>

<p>So if you want to try this out for yourself, thats something you could do quite easily.</p>

<p>Now that I think of this, I think I have seen a similar kind of effect on bags filled with water, or if you turn a lense in a particular way. I am not sure if its
the same interference mechanism that creates that type of behavior, but it looks very similar, just instead of a line, its more like a 2D projection. And there might
be different starting conditions since here more complicated things like refraction and reflection are involved.</p>

<p>Anyway, Here is a video that someone did to demonstrate it</p>

<p>And here is an image of light refraction pattern in water :

<p>And here is an image of laser reflection :
