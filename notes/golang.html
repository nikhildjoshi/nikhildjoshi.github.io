	<p><strong>This post is mostly a rant. Be warned, I hate Go, and I hate pretentious people. No disrespect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a> though.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Golang</strong> , a language created by people who created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9</a>. Plan 9 was an operating system that was supposed to pioneer distributed os. In reality it never picked off. I haven’t seen it and I don’t need to comment on merits or demerits of it.</p>

<p>It also sounds like he has some grudge against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>. Anyway, sounds like somewhere in 2009 he announced along with Ken Thompson, announced Golang. The claim being</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity
 in an era of multicore, networked machines and extremely large codebases."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My personal experience with Golang has been kind of a mixed bag. I wasn’t really blown by anything that the language was able to do. I have done much things with C++ , and now very few things impress me, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>A few advantages of language include simple package management (to be read as “no package management”), and no versioning.( Things which are going to be introduced in Golang v2, lol).</p>

<p>After programming in it for about 4-5 months, and migrating a project over from C to golang, my honest opinion is of a language trying to re-invent the wheel, and a language which would end up not being able to do it more properly than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Golang also does many crazy things like growing/shrinking stacks while program is running :/, using some Plan9 function calling conventions, etc.. The language feels very productive, if throwing up a quick code suey is the daily thyng. My biggest complain is re-inventing class objects, and creating arbitrary features like “slices”.. There is literally no advantage in doing that.</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="https://gobyexample.com/slices">slices</a></em></strong> for example. WhyTF does anyone need slices ? What problem do they solve ? Its just some syntactic sugar, and not even fool proof at doing what it does…<a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals">impl of slices</a>.</p>

<p>I also feel Rob is very pretentious.He claims Go is simple. I mean sure it is simple, <strong>but</strong> it doesn’t include all the rich feature sets that other languages have.eg. I want to pass a variable and have guarentee that it cannot be changed by the function…tough luck can’t do that, because, <em>"less is more"</em> or whatever the fk, says Mr.Pike.</p>

<p>He claims Bjarne went all over to heavily promote C++, but, then he himself is promoting the language like crazy. And in any case, language didn’t gain much any traction untill Google put its weight behind the language.</p>

<p>Moreover, adding things like generics, versioning etc… is making the language closer to java anyway… so the simplicity was I think a scam ! <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go2draft">Golang 2 does everything Golang is supposedly against</a>…</p>

<p>Error handling , propagation etc is a shit show. Its confused between error handling as done by Java and as done by C.</p>

<p>In any case, I would much prefer working with something like Rust if adopting a new langauge is something that is real priority.  Rust will probably be the language (if any ) to replace a system programming language of the future.</p>
