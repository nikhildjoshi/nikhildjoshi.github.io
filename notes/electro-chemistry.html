	<p><strong>Today</strong> is the day I try my first electro chemistry related experiment, after my high school, for the first time. Goal is to produce pottasium chlorate.</p>

<h6 id="brushing-up-basics">Brushing up basics</h6>

<p>Alright, so the first thing to do was to brush up some fundamentals of chemistry and electro chemistry, in particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry">Stoichiometry</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anion</strong> : an ion that is attracted by anode, ie. the ion has net negative charge, due to additional electrons.eg. Cl-, O- etc..</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cation</strong> : an ion that is attracted by cathode, ie. the ion has net positive charge, due to missing electrons. eg H+</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oxidation</strong> : A state in which electron is lost, and as can be seen, Anions are oxidized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduction</strong> : A state in which electron is gained, as can be seens, cations are reduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mole</strong> : A measure of quantity, that deals with measuring number of units (could be electrons, molecules, atoms) , as opposed to their mass. One mole is defined as avogadro’s constant ie. <script type="math/tex">6.02214076\times10^{23}</script> . eg. One mole of charge is equal to avogadro’s constant.. eg. One mole of Chlorine molecule is equal to <script type="math/tex">6.02214076\times10^{23}</script> molecules of <script type="math/tex">Cl_2</script>. The weight of 1 mole of <script type="math/tex">Cl_2</script> is 35.453gms (atomic weight of <script type="math/tex">Cl_2</script> is 35.453 amu).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Overpotential</strong> : Overpotential is the ability of an anode to not participate into the electrochemical reaction untill additional/over energy/volt/potential is provided. For example, assume that we want to disallow oxygen evolution(formation of oxygen) on anode, then we need an anode that has HIGH oxygen evolution overpotential. These over potentials for a particular anode are different for different elements. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpotential">See this wikipedia article for overpotentials of Hydrogen, Oxygen, Chlorine for various types of electrodes</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is important because, electricity works on least resistance principle. So given that we have two Anions, the one that can be evolved with lowest over potential gets priority.</p>

<h6 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1</h6>

<p>Alright so the theory is that, to create pottasium chlorate, we simply need to electrolyze a saturated solution of pottasium chloride(salt substitute). I did this without any research, just threw together some rods in a brine solution, and powered it with a 2Amp 5v (10Watt) charger.</p>
<center style="border: 1px solid black;">
<br />
<img src="/assets/fail1.jpg" alt="" width="20%" />
<span> Complete failure</span>
</center>

<p>As with all things done on a whim, it was a terrible failure. The result was a gooey orange green liquid. (edit: those crystals were Feric Chloride complexes, particularly <script type="math/tex">FeCl_2, FeCl_3</script>)
Tried to boil it down, and got a few glowy orange crystals. Were they <script type="math/tex">FeCl_x</script> or <script type="math/tex">Fe_xO_x</script> types, I have no clue.</p>

<h6 id="where-is-my-pottasium-chlorate-">Where is my pottasium chlorate ?</h6>

<p>Ok so this time more search and finding. Firstly, the last experiment failed because of the use of steel as the Anode. Steel is mostly Iron, the Chlorine anion(the one that goes to anode since it has negative charge), readily combines with Fe, to produce chloride salts of Iron. In other words, the electrochemistry actually consumed the anode as it went on… brutal!</p>

<p>So apparently I need an anode made of either of graphite,lead dioxide,(Mixed Metal Oxide)MMO, or platinum. Basically Anodes that don’t participate in the reaction, but just are inert. I choose Graphite since its the cheapest alternative.</p>

<p>My cell is still a glass bottle with an anode made of Graphite, and a cathode made of stainless steel.At minimum I want to know how much  time should I keep the cell running. I can get this info from the following calculations:</p>

<p>Get atomic weight of an element, say oxygen. It is 16 AMU(the unit for atomic weights a really small number of gms), now consider a mole of Oxygen, this is given by AVO’s number, now if we multiply weight per atom into number of atoms, we get the weight in gms.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
& total\ weight\ in\ gms \\
& = ATOMs\ in\ a\ mole \times 1\ AMU\ \times Oxygen's\ AMU. \\
& = (6.02214076 \times 10^{23}) \times 16 \\
& = (1.661 \times 10^{-24}) \times 16 \\
& = 1.000 \times 16 \\
& = 16 gms. \\
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Similar to above, we get the molar weights of K and Cl, and since we want <script type="math/tex">KClO_3</script> we sum them up.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
& for K, Cl, O_3 \\
& = molarGms(Cl) + molarGms(K) + 3\times molarGms(O) \\
& = 39.10gms + 35.453gms + 3 \times 16gms \\
& = 122.5gms.
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>For now we assume that 6 moles of electrons are required to get 1 mole of <script type="math/tex">KClO_3</script>.
We get the time and ampers as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
& totalCharge\ in\ columbs\ in\ 6\ moles\ of\ electrons \\
&= totalElectrons\ in\ 6\ moles \times chargeInAnElectron\ Columbs \\
&= 6 moles \times electrons\ per\ mole \times chargeInAnElectron \\
&= 6\times6.02214076\times10^{23}\  \times\  (1.602176634\times10^{-19}) \\
&= 6 * 96485.40 Coulombs.
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Since 1 coulomb of charge passed in a second is considered 1 amp, <script type="math/tex">6\times96485.40</script>
coulombs of charge passed in second is considered <script type="math/tex">6\times96485.40</script> amps. That amount
of current would burn all things in its path, so, we can increase the number of seconds,
and reduce number of Amps. If we divide 96485.40 by number of seconds in a day we get 
~1.12 Amps.  So a charge of 1.12 amps for a days time will give us one mole of electrons.</p>

<p>This means in 6 days, we can pass 6 moles of electrons.
And in 9 days, we can pass approximately 9 moles of electrons.</p>

<h6 id="experiment-2">Experiment 2</h6>
<ul>
  <li>100 ml water, and around 30 mg of Kcl ( 1 mole of KCl is 74gm, so this is 40% of that).</li>
  <li>Since we would need 1 amps for 6 days for 1 mole of KCl, it means we need 2.5 days, at 1amps.
Or, 1.25 days at 2 amps. I decided to pass 2Amps into it. Cell is a simple glass jar with one carbon andoe, and one steel cathode.</li>
  <li>I also added some of the water from my original failed run, in hopes of salvaging any chlorate it may have. Alas, the only thing it did was give the liquid a wierd color.</li>
  <li>After 1.25 day, I see that carbon rod was erroded and liquid was a black goo. After freezing it,
I got the following 
<br /></li>
</ul>
<center style="border: 5px solid black;">
<img src="/assets/fail2.jpg" alt="" width="40%" />
<span> Partial success </span>
</center>

<ul>
  <li>After that I added water to it, removed the carbon using a filter, and boiled it a bit to remove added excess water. Result was far more cooler :</li>
</ul>
<center style="border: 1px solid black;">
<br />
<img src="/assets/at3.jpg" alt="" width="40%" />
<span> Partial success </span>
</center>

<ul>
  <li>40% of 122gm is around 50gm, so at a 100% efficiency that is what I should have got. 60% would then be around 30gm, but in reality I got around 20gm chlorate. or efficiency of 40%.</li>
</ul>
