          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;rying to get my hands full with embedded ARM cores this year. Trying few raspberry PI kits. So, first thing, get a boot loader working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picked up all the essentials from &lt;a href=&quot;https://elinux.org/RPi_U-Boot&quot;&gt;bootloader section at elinux&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to run the tools, I got the following wierdity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;file ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;SYSV&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;GNU/Linux 2.6.15, BuildID[sha1]&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;e2801f48a84144e2b40d6083baac317057662b3c, stripped

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
bash: ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc: No such file or directory

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rwxr-xr-x&lt;/span&gt; 1 hk47 hk47 560424 Jan 25 22:52 ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTF, its an exec file. but, running it causes bash to report an error claiming the file doesn’t exist. Whats going on here ? Lets try strace..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;strace ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
execve&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueab&quot;&lt;/span&gt;...], 0x7ffc79750a70 /&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; 35 vars &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt; ENOENT &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;No such file or directory&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
.....&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so it did try to execv the file, and it returned ENOENT. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html&quot;&gt;execv man page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; says ENOENT would mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;   ENOENT The file filename or a script or ELF interpreter does not
              exist, or a shared library needed &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;the file or interpreter
              cannot be found.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the file clearly exist, the candidates now are elf interpreter or shared lib for the interpreter. lets try ldd to see if we get any missing libraries. And since ldd doesn’t know what the fuck is going on, then we try readelf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ldd ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc

lib32-glibc usr/lib/ld-linux.so.2
lib32-glibc usr/lib32/ld-linux.so.2

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pacman &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--sync&lt;/span&gt; lib32-glibc
...
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ldd ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
ldd ./arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
	linux-gate.so.1 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0xf7edc000&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	libc.so.6 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/lib32/libc.so.6 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0xf7ce3000&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	/lib/ld-linux.so.2 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/lib/ld-linux.so.2 &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0xf7ede000&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so as can be seen this seems like a case of missing interpreter, so we just need the ld-linux.so.2 file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just install lib32-glibc.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Golang</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is mostly a rant. Be warned, I hate Go, and I hate pretentious people. No disrespect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson&quot;&gt;Ken Thompson&lt;/a&gt; though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golang&lt;/strong&gt; , a language created by people who created &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs&quot;&gt;Plan 9&lt;/a&gt;. Plan 9 was an operating system that was supposed to pioneer distributed os. In reality it never picked off. I haven’t seen it and I don’t need to comment on merits or demerits of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also sounds like he has some grudge against &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup&quot;&gt;Bjarne Stroustrup&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, sounds like somewhere in 2009 he announced along with Ken Thompson, announced Golang. The claim being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity
 in an era of multicore, networked machines and extremely large codebases.&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal experience with Golang has been kind of a mixed bag. I wasn’t really blown by anything that the language was able to do. I have done much things with C++ , and now very few things impress me, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few advantages of language include simple package management (to be read as “no package management”), and no versioning.( Things which are going to be introduced in Golang v2, lol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After programming in it for about 4-5 months, and migrating a project over from C to golang, my honest opinion is of a language trying to re-invent the wheel, and a language which would end up not being able to do it more properly than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang also does many crazy things like growing/shrinking stacks while program is running :/, using some Plan9 function calling conventions, etc.. The language feels very productive, if throwing up a quick code suey is the daily thyng. My biggest complain is re-inventing class objects, and creating arbitrary features like “slices”.. There is literally no advantage in doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gobyexample.com/slices&quot;&gt;slices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for example. WhyTF does anyone need slices ? What problem do they solve ? Its just some syntactic sugar, and not even fool proof at doing what it does…&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals&quot;&gt;impl of slices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel Rob is very pretentious.He claims Go is simple. I mean sure it is simple, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; it doesn’t include all the rich feature sets that other languages have.eg. I want to pass a variable and have guarentee that it cannot be changed by the function…tough luck can’t do that, because, &lt;em&gt;&quot;less is more&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or whatever the fk, says Mr.Pike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He claims Bjarne went all over to heavily promote C++, but, then he himself is promoting the language like crazy. And in any case, language didn’t gain much any traction untill Google put its weight behind the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, adding things like generics, versioning etc… is making the language closer to java anyway… so the simplicity was I think a scam ! &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/go2draft&quot;&gt;Golang 2 does everything Golang is supposedly against&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error handling , propagation etc is a shit show. Its confused between error handling as done by Java and as done by C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I would much prefer working with something like Rust if adopting a new langauge is something that is real priority.  Rust will probably be the language (if any ) to replace a system programming language of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Dual Nature Light</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;ight, such an interesting form of energy! Since an animal is born, and it opens eyes for the first time, this energy enters their eyes, and provides a massive information flow.
Probably the most information they will ever get is from the medium of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I stumbled on an article for dual nature of light. It is a fascinatiing concept.  So I wanted to see this for myself, so I tried to see what could be done to get this going , my solution was to use a hair as a windowing/splitting mechanism, on top of a laser pointer, and that worked like a charm !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to try this out for yourself, thats something you could do quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I think of this, I think I have seen a similar kind of effect on bags filled with water, or if you turn a lense in a particular way. I am not sure if its
the same interference mechanism that creates that type of behavior, but it looks very similar, just instead of a line, its more like a 2D projection. And there might
be different starting conditions since here more complicated things like refraction and reflection are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Here is a video that someone did to demonstrate it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is an image of light refraction pattern in water :
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fkwo9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water reflections&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is an image of laser reflection :
&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Single_slit_and_double_slit2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water reflections&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things to read on this , here are a few links :&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Incremental Page Loading</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;oday I propsed a new way to do javascript based dynamic rendering.
After migrating from a native blink rendering solution, we moved to javascript.  Speed, power , and resources were heavily consumed. I took a look at the same page loading at 3x low speeds. It was painful to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently using SVG/XML in order to render pages instead of HTNL. The svg is generated from chromium’s compositor, and in that , using skia.
We did see that most of the time was clearly being spent on recreating the nodes of the SVG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the idea that I proposed was to take two frames as SVG, compute the difference, and then only apply the difference. To complicate things, we do want to see partial differences. ie. If two nodes are differing by only one character, then those two should be matched as same nodes with the delta as a chagne between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were simply a yes/no comparison, the problem was very simple. It was to compare a two trees. But with the idea that partial comparisons should be properly resolved, it becomes harder. How ? Why ? Lets consider an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- frame 1 --!&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tag1 atribs1234&amp;gt; node a
&amp;lt;tag1 atribs1456&amp;gt; node b
&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- frame 2 --!&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;tag1 atribs234&amp;gt; node a
&amp;lt;tag1 atribs1236&amp;gt; node b
&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how do you figure out which node from frame 2 should match node from frame 1 ? Intutively, we can see that node a from frame 1 differs with node a from frame 2 by absence of attrib1, so, there is 1 change required to convert frame 1 nodea to frame2 node a. This is a delete operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can see that to convert a node from A to B, we need to apply a few operations to it. The number and cost of such operations then is the value that we can give to a pair of nodes, as a score. If we calculate this score for each pair of node, and then get a sorted list of these scores, that would give us the most optimal arrangement of node mappings, such that to convert each node to its corresponding node, the minimum number of operations need to be applied !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many well known edit distance /levenstien distance calculation codes that could be deployed to calculate this score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, we want this to be calculated with each node. These operations are typically non linear. And we have around thousand nodes atleast on a frame. This means we cannot use edit distance. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enter-the-engineer&quot;&gt;Enter the Engineer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now need to reduce the time it takes, since this is a critical path operation, the rendering speed and therefore FPS depends on it. So does battery, power and resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first thing to observe here is that, we don’t necessarily need like a 100% proper score, we just need similar nodes. What are other similarity calculators that are easier and cheaper to operate on ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One similarity calculation could be to just count frequency of character, and use the distribution as a signature. Since most SVG is only a subset of characters, this would most likely give us faster speeds ? Lets think about this, xml tags generally don’t use full a to z characters. It also uses numbers, and mis chars like = “ , etc.. this means, we can convert 200 chars to 50 ish chars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our time complexity looks like O(200+200) for converting a string into signature of 50 characters. And then O(50) to compare the two signatures.
This is a clear improvement over O(200*200) worst case for edit distance calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still can’t get away with the N*N comparision though. Sorting could still be done quite easily and cheaply using something like insertion sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well so that would be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each node, convert it to its signature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then, just do a N*N tabular comparison, and sort it by scores.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each pair with lowest to highest scores,
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get changed, added or deleted attributes, and they are the node delta.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <title>Aluminium Flash Powder</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back on subject of fireworks&lt;/strong&gt;, now that I am pretty much done with gunpowder and rocket candies, now its time for another firework trick mixture, “flash powder”. A flash powder is a mixture of oxidizer and a fuel, just like gunpowder or rocket candy. The reason its called &lt;strong&gt;flash powder&lt;/strong&gt; is because it burns more vigirously and produces a bright flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original application of flash powders was in photography. Since there weren’t halogens or any other powerfull sources of light, the effect was produced by actually burning flash powders in order to create the flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;ruminations&quot;&gt;Ruminations&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know from my middle school that magnesium burns pretty bright, that was the first thing that came to my mind, and sure enough, magnesium is definitely one of the major ingredients in flash powder, its costly though :). Since I am not doing anything serious, and I am not going to become a proffessional pyrotechnic, I am contended with doing simple cheap alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be using &lt;strong&gt;aluminium&lt;/strong&gt;. I had no clue that finely powdered aluminium is actually a fuel that burns almost like charcoal! Nay, better than charcoal, it supposedly can sponteneously ignite at lower tempratures than charcoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some surprises here, in my view , I had thought for the longest time that metals don’t burn except at a very high temprature.. T_T. Looks like metals when their size is small enough act almost like a &quot; sponge &quot; that captures and either adds to, or multiplies the heat absorbed from outside and somehow reaches ignition tempratures, for example iron burns at 816 degree C, but, I have seen iron wool burn with a matchstick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly aluminium burns at 600 degree C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I am going to combine some coal, aluminium and some nitrate. I hope to get atleast some flash out of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;metals-as-fuels-&quot;&gt;Metals as fuels ?&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;experiment&quot;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some coal nitrate and aluminium. Firstly I took them in proportions of 70, 25, 5. 5 being aluminium. And sure enough, it does throw up bright sparks in between coal sparks. It appears quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a second mixture, with ratios 60, 10, 30. And this is quite bright, but doesn’t burn compltely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;bonus-composition--thermite&quot;&gt;Bonus composition : Thermite&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thermite is as a composition is perhaps the best in terms of heat production. This simple mixture is made up of rust of Iron (Fe2O3, Fe2O5 etc) and aluminium. A finely powedered mixture of rust and aluminium can be mixed together througly, and after application of some energy, the oxygen from the iron transfers to the more unstable aluminium. The reaction is highly exothermic, and tempratures enough to melt iron is generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is so effective in generating molten iron, that this is used to weld train tracks! For reference train tracks are atleast 15cm by 5cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looks like to burn aluminium properly, you first need some charcoal based fire, that reaches the burning point of aluminium, and then they all vigirously burn and support each other.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A small amount of aluminium will throw up bright yellow-white sparks in between the more dimmer reddish coal sparks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording this behavior is somewhat of a nightmare due to auto adjusting brightness of all modern cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will be able to feel the temprature difference if you burn a metal fuel (mostly aluminium).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <description>&lt;h6 id=&quot;distributing-web-workload-evenly&quot;&gt;Distributing web workload evenly&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a thought, why is it that pages that load on the browser in modern days
are so slow ? Well multiple reasons…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will talk about some reasons that I think slow down page perf
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;http-archive&quot;&gt;HTTP Archive&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the biggest site to understand the distribtion of content,
its bandwidth consumption, and its effect on page load time. Here is a description of
bandwidth run for mobiles for 2018.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=400x225&amp;amp;cht=p&amp;amp;chco=007099&amp;amp;chd=t:604,47,46,322,30,578&amp;amp;chds=0,604&amp;amp;chdlp=b&amp;amp;chdl=total%201629%20kB&amp;amp;chl=Images+-+604+kB%7CHTML+-+47+kB%7CStylesheets+-+46+kB%7CScripts+-+322+kB%7CFonts+-+30+kB%7CVideo+-+578+kB&amp;amp;chma=|5&amp;amp;chtt=Average+Bytes+per+Page+by+Content+Type&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a small example, the site has lots of good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;computing-on-the-client-side&quot;&gt;Computing on the client side.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of loading a web page can be distilled into two parts. First, a network
constricted resource fetch operation, and second, a compute constricted compute operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web pages designed in the western world, do not represent the average b/w or compute power
of people in this world. Therefore for the web to scale, we need newer methods, perhaps, newer
more decentralized architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to forever solve this problem is to design web pages by taking into consideration the bandwidth of the user( estimating b/w of the end user is a problem in its own right), there could even be a grade of features and things enabled or disabled based on real time statistics for the given user (this for example is typically done on a video quality degradation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other stop gap solutions, that try to optimize certain aspects of trying to load a page. for example, A data compressing proxy can be used to reduce the strain on end user b/w. Something like a REACT js can be used to more or less stream the changes to the screen, this improves the end user experience, but isn’t that much great on b/w consumption etc etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might still be some scope for translating a given page and its resources based on the end user bandwidth and compute powers on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Nitrates</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrates&lt;/strong&gt; the oxidizer that we saw last post, is the main ingredient of gunpowder.
But now questions is how to produce this ? Or rather how did people produce this in history , and can we produce it ? This post contains some information regarding my information gathering for producing Pottasium nitrate…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ancient China, and India, it was produced by harvesting the marshy clay and purifying it, add water, then boil, then add ash of particular high pottasium woods, and then , filter the stuff again. Boil to reduce the water, and then let it cool, see the crystals of Kno3 precipitate. They are needle shaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashes of woods contain carbonates of calcium, pottasium etc.. Then clearly those that contain more pottasium will contain more pottasium carbonate (KCO3). The K in the KCO3 is what we are after, and hence the use of wood ash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why are there nitrates in marshy lands in the first place ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;strong&gt;The Nitrogen Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;nitrogen-cycle&quot;&gt;Nitrogen Cycle.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen cycle describes conversion of elemental nitrogen (N2 gas in air) to various compounds of nitrogen, and how nitrogen moves in and out of organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a diagram from wikipedia commons, that very succicintly describes the cycle.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/The_Nitrogen_Cycle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nitrogen Cycle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the important part for us is the nitrification cycle, as you can see nitrifying bacteria are the bacteria that take amonia as input, and produce nitrites (NO2), then some other bacteria take the nitrite, and produce nitrates (NO3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nitrates(NO3) as you know are the radical that we need to combine with Pottasium (K) to produce the oxidizer Pottasium Nitrates (KNO3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion of Amonium or Amonia to nitrite is done by classes of bacteria called “Amonia Oxidizing Bacteria” (AOB). One of these are called &lt;strong&gt;Nitrosomonas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2.NH4(+) + 3.O2 --&amp;gt; 2.NO2(-) + 2.H2O + 4.H(+) ...[yours truly Nitrosomonas, Comammox]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion of nitrite(NO2) to nitrates(NO3) is done by class of bacteria called Nitrite Oxidizing Bacteria (NOB). One of these are called &lt;strong&gt;Nitrobacter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2.NO2(−) + O2 --&amp;gt; 2.NO3(-) ...[yours truely,Nitrobacter, Nitrospira, Comammox]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;enough-with-the-theory--how-do-i-do-it-&quot;&gt;Enough with the theory , how do I do it !&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by 17th to 18th century, there were multiple production techniques that were developed that created artificial marshy conditions in hope of harnessing whatever ‘magic’ that created the nitrates in natural marshes. And these people were more or less successful in their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so lets think about this, we need as input amonia or amonium thats NH3 or NH4, then, we want as output NO2 and then NO3, alright then, we need oxygen for sure. Turns out, AOBs need CO2 to oxidize NH3/4 to NO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical source for amonia was urine, which contains urea(CH4N2O). We then need oxygen (we can get that from air at reasonable rates), and , our friendly bacteria the AOBs , that will take oxygen from air, do their magic, and produce nitrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our other friends, NOBs will then take this nitrite and then convert it into nitrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we will leech(fancy word for dissolving in water, and seperating by flitration) the nitrates from the said mush, and get a solution of nitrates (potentially calcium nitrates). We can then treat it with KCL to get KNo3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;todo&quot;&gt;TODO&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Need to get a source of urea/amonia, probably just urine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nitrifying bacteria are available as aquarium cleaning aids.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pottasium is available as Pottasium chloride or Potash.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I always wanted to do some hydroponics experiments, probably I will do this when I am dealing with hydroponics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should also be noted that those nitrates in water are probably pottasium nitrates (CaNO3), which when reacted with potash (KCO3) can potentially produce KNO3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          <title>Gunpowder</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alright&lt;/strong&gt; staying true to my goal, I have some time this week. Read a few things about gunpowder, and fire in general.
To summarize it quickly, to make fire, we need fuel, oxygen, and some activation energy. Thinking back at my childhood experiences
this makes sense, almost everytime I have lit fire, those 3 were present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important bit now is how to get oxygen. Oxygen is at ~20% in air, so a burning substance has 8 in 10 chance of not combusting
becuse of lack of oxygen. So, how do we improve flow of oxygen ? The easiest way is to find chemical compounds that release oxygen
when they are heated. As we apply the activation energy in the form of fire, this substance will heat, and release additional oxygen
into the fuel, that will burn the fuel more than if it was burnt only by oxygen in air. This particular set of substances used for
producing oxygen are called &lt;strong&gt;oxidizers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, I do remember about reading a rocket working principle book, that had oxygen along with fuel in its tanks. Also , I don’t remember ever reading that increasing the amount of oxygen cause more vigirous burning of fuels in my school science texts. Its somewhat dangerous to not teach this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the topic of oxidizers, apparently pottasium nitrate is the most famous of them all, and most ancient of them all.
The origin of gunpowder is as is a difficult subject, some people claim it was China, some claim it was India. Well, both of these
places have large marshy lands, which are primmed for production of nitrates. More on nitrates in a later post. Since there are more proofs that point to Chinese origins, we will go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our gunpowder experiment, the general formula is sulphur, charcoal powder, and pottasium nitrate mixed in a 5, 20, 75 ratio. There are a few things to keep in mind, while doing this experiment. First, its related to fire (Agni) so be respectful (alert). Second, we do not want to do any crazy things,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting all the required things , I tested each of the substances individually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;sulphur&quot;&gt;Sulphur&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applying a match, it will burn with a blue flame.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combustion starts at about 400C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Melts at about 115C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In case of gunpowder, sulphur plays an important role. It first of all is used to equally spread the heat , so that the oxidizer starts releasing oxygen early in the game, this saturates the air around the mixture with oxygen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;charcoal&quot;&gt;Charcoal&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On application of a match, charcoal powder produced some sparks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Produced by pyrolysis of wood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hydrocarbon, with varying formula, but typically C6H10.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Its a hydrocarbon that burns at around 700+ C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At its max, it can burn at more than 2000+ C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the main fuel for gunpowder, given its high energy content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has many micro porus structures, which can soak up other chemicals. for eg. activated charcoal is used to trap chemicals in water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;pottasium-nitrate-kno3&quot;&gt;Pottasium Nitrate (KNO3)&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Undoubtedly the MVP of this gunpowder thing…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Nitrate radicle has 3 oxygen atoms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These atoms can be released as diatomic oxygen(o2) on application of heat
at around 500C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This release of oxygen is what makes it most usefull compound. Such compounds are generally termed &quot;oxidizers&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This doesn’t burn, melts on application of match, and then converts into a white solids (KCo3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;bonus-ingredient-sucrose-c6h12o6&quot;&gt;Bonus ingredient Sucrose (C6H12O6)&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Common house hold sugar is carbohydrate (as opposed to hydrocarbon).
Carbs conain oxygen atoms also, in addition to C, and H.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It burns at around 300 to 400C, and produces a carbon residue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It melts at 160C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Burning of sucrose produces a LOT of high temprature steam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;principle-of-operation&quot;&gt;Principle of operation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how individual ingredients operate, we now simply need to mix them in appropriate proportions. The generally accepted proportions for sulphur : charcoal : nitrate is 15:20:75. This formula has changed quite a bit based on what type wood was used for production of the charcoal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the way this is supposed to work is, sulphur is the first one to melt and ignite, the heated melted sulphur in turn heats the nitrate, causing decomposition, and release of oxygen, this further builds up the heat, causing more oxygen, untill it ultimately reaches charcoal ignition tempratures, and then things just fly from there onwards.
Generally accepted simplistic formula is stated as :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;	10.KNO3 + 8.C + 3.S ---&amp;gt; 2.K2CO3 + 3.K2SO4 + 6.CO2 + 5.N2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I want to iterate faster, and there are multiple thing I want to try I will make no more than 5g powder at a time. There are multiple things I need to try, and multiple preparation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic thrust of all preparation methods is to introduce as many KNo3 molecules closer to Charcol molecules as possible. And there have been suggested various methods. I will try three main methods, first a simple mixing using mortar pestle, two, using wet mortal pestle, and three with sugar syrup instead of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various different 5g powder samples prepared and ignited, here are few key things that I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding sulphur makes very little impact on burn rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Method of preparation makes a LOT of impact on burn rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reducing KNO3 quantity doesn’t affect much, if, mixing isn’t done properly, it simply leaves residue, but burn speed isn’t affected that much.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding some sugar causes the mixture to become hard and grainy, this causes more air gaps between the mixtures, and that probably cause better burn rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding sulphur produces a lot more heat than without sulphur.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shit ton of smoke is produced if sulphur is added. If sulphur is not added, the amount of smoke is less than half of with sulphur(approximation).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wet grinding is the way to go, just take some water and keep on grinding the mixture a good about 5 mins. Dry it throughly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;my-best-attempt&quot;&gt;My best attempt&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best mix I obtained was simply Charcoal, Kno3, Sugar in quantities of 30 : 65 : 5, with water grinding. This is safe mixture that doesn’t produce any corrosive gases or anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;bonus-composition-rocket-candy&quot;&gt;Bonus composition &quot;Rocket candy&quot;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright adding sugar and Kno3 in proportions roughly 50:50 or 40:60. The mixture is prepared by boiling some water with kno3 and sugar, at &lt;strong&gt;VERY LOW HEAT&lt;/strong&gt;. I repeat &lt;strong&gt;VERY LOW HEAT&lt;/strong&gt;. Stop it as soon as it reaches a melted cheese like consistency. Once its stopped, the mix is like a dough, or a molten glass, its hot, and mouldable, just mold it into a shape. When its cold, it is like a candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a 10 grams composition, and that stuff produces lots of steam, it also seems to have quite a bit of energy. When I made it burn, it produced some type of motion, so clearly it has energy to propell, hence the name Rocket candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;in-action&quot;&gt;In action&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;border:2px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;dry mixed pottasium nitrate and charcoal powder in ratio of 70 30&lt;/td&gt;

          <title>Fireworks</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; I was between 7 to 18yrs of age. Fireworks were one of my most fav things to waste time on.
I am a Hindu, and there is a festival of Diwali(lights), thats a period where everyone* bursts a bunch
 of fireworks. Its supposed to ward off evil, and create positive impact.  I was always fascinated by 
the fireworks, but since internet wasn’t a thing back then, knowledge was limited.
I used to ask my dad(who was a dokotor) or then one of my paternal uncles, or learn by observation,
primary source was observing my brothers, cousins, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things I could figure out on my own, or by observing others. My very first firecracker experience was
when I was maybe about 5 yrs old, and I was so scared of it, that I fell while running, away.
Then after observing my brother, I finally understood how it works, and it was kinda neat. Use a hot
stick to light it, and after a set time it explodes. My elder cousins would take the mis-fired firecrackers
cut it open, pour out the powder on a paper, and set it on fire, that would cause a flash of smoke and fire
when the said powder burned. It was all very cool to see. I had assumed back then that the powder was something like
1) a match stick, 2) a camphor 3) petrol/kerosene which are all inflamable. I knew the basic science that
Oxygen was needed to light fire, but didn’t make the connection, that there are sources of oxygen other than
air. For me back then, petrol and gunpowder were both almost the same w.r.t fire, both of them burned vigorously when lit
on fire. Oh yeah, and I knew about camphor because its a central item in Hindu rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After gaining this new info, I cut open a few fireworks. Observation was that firecrackers that would explode with loud bang
contained some kind of silvery-grey powder, when it was on the hand, it reflected a silvery metalic color.
The rockets, or crackers in general that wizz, had a dark, almost black smooth powder, this looked like soot
from lamps. Flowerpots etc, had some time of peletts. These beads would just glow for a while and then do nothing.
There was some wierd powder, that I never understood, it was white in color, and there was nothing like it
in any of the other firecrackers. This powder, was from crackers that produced a musical note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my early teens, I used to mix two pots together, or , add another cracker on a rocket, or , use
sparkels, and add them into pots etc etc… basicall just basic combining things to see whats produced.
I remember doing a pretty good firepot made from rocket dust, and crushed sparkels. There always was one effect
that I couldn’t produce…nor did I understand how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the whistling effect. I noticed early on that the firecrackers that produced this whistle were costly.
They wizzed like rockets. They had a white powder, that didn’t burn like any of the other powders. It either lit
up quite quickly, or just smoked. At this time, I wasn’t clever enough at that time to figure out, how were they
producing sound. My theory was its gotta do with the container they are in, like for eg. a whistle. To my surprise
they still produced whistle , no matter how I changed the container shape… so it was a mystry to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do remember reading somewhere that there are some special compositions involved in creating black powder,
but I never did it, never made the time, Diwali is seasonal affair, and immediately following diwali, we had some
educational stuff to do. I do remember reading somewhere that there are some special compositions involved in 
creating black powder, but I never did it, never got the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I came across an interesting article on nitrates leeching into soil, and while reading some of that
realized that nitrates are one of the main oxidizers used in fireworks. Finally I am now somewhat stable from 
some aspects of my life, that I can invest some time in this as a hobby. Starting today I am going to try to DIY 
a few things, and get a closure on something that 
I always wanted to do.. in particular create some black powder, and ultimately create a whistle based off of 
firework compositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see how it goes..&lt;/p&gt;
